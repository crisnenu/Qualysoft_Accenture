Exercise 1.
Use your preferred test automation tool to automate the test case: Go to your favorite e-shop, navigate to some category and add the two most expensive items to the shopping cart from this category. Provide code from implementation.

Exercise 2.
Write a program in your preferred programming language that counts backwards from 100 to 1 and prints: “Agile” if the number is divisible by 5, “Software” if the number is divisible by 3, “Testing” if the number is divisible by both, or prints just the number if none of those cases are true.
